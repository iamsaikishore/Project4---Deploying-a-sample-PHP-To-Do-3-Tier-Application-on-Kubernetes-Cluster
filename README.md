### Installing Docker

#### Uninstall old versions

Older versions of Docker went by the names of docker, docker.io, or docker-engine, you might also have installations of containerd or runc. Uninstall any such older versions before attempting to install a new version:

```shell
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```
```apt-get``` might report that you have none of these packages installed.

#### Install using the apt repository

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

**Set up the repository**

   1. Update the ```apt``` package index and install packages to allow ```apt``` to use a repository over HTTPS:

```shell
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
  ca-certificates \
  curl \
  gnupg
```

   2. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

```shell
sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

   3. Use the following command to set up the repository:

```shell
echo \
"deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
"$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

#### Install Docker Engine

   1. Update the apt package index:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
```

   Receiving a GPG error when running apt-get update?

   Your default umask may be incorrectly configured, preventing detection of the repository public key file. Try granting read permission for the Docker public key file before updating the package index:

```shell
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo apt-get update
```

   2. Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.

To install the latest version, run:

```shell
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
```

   3. Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:

```shell
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

#### Installing kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl

   1. Update the apt package index and install packages needed to use the Kubernetes apt repository:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
```

   2. Download the Google Cloud public signing key:

```shell
sudo curl -fsSLo /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg
```

   3. Add the Kubernetes apt repository:

```shell
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```

   4. Update apt package index, install kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl, and pin their version:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

#### Creating a cluster with kubeadm

To initialize the control-plane node run:

```shell
kubeadm init <args>
```
```kubeadm init``` first runs a series of prechecks to ensure that the machine is ready to run Kubernetes. These prechecks expose warnings and exit on errors. kubeadm init then downloads and installs the cluster control plane components. This may take several minutes. After it finishes you should see:

```shell
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a Pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  /docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
```

To make kubectl work for your non-root user, run these commands, which are also part of the kubeadm init output:

```shell
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

```shell
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```



### What is Kubeadm?

Kubeadm is a tool built to provide kubeadm init and kubeadm join as best-practice "fast paths" for creating Kubernetes clusters.

kubeadm performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable cluster up and running. By design, it cares only about bootstrapping, not about provisioning machines. Likewise, installing various nice-to-have addons, like the Kubernetes Dashboard, monitoring solutions, and cloud-specific addons, is not in scope.

Instead, we expect higher-level and more tailored tooling to be built on top of kubeadm, and ideally, using kubeadm as the basis of all deployments will make it easier to create conformant clusters.

#### Installing kubeadm and neccesary packages on master and worker nodes. For reference check the kubeadm_master_install.sh and kubeadm_node_install.sh shell scripts.

Now connect to master node

```shell
   sudo -i
   sudo apt update -y
   sudo apt install git -y #By default git is installed on Ubuntu 22.04
   git clone https://github.com/iamsaikishore/Project4---Deploying-a-sample-PHP-To-Do-3-Tier-Application-on-Kubernetes-Cluster.git
   cd Project4---Deploying-a-sample-PHP-To-Do-3-Tier-Application-on-Kubernetes-Cluster
   chmod 777 kubeadm_master_install.sh kubeadm_node_install.sh
   sh kubeadm_master_install.sh
```

Now connect to worker node

```shell
   sudo -i
   git clone https://github.com/iamsaikishore/Project4---Deploying-a-sample-PHP-To-Do-3-Tier-Application-on-Kubernetes-Cluster.git
   cd Project4---Deploying-a-sample-PHP-To-Do-3-Tier-Application-on-Kubernetes-Cluster
   chmod 777 kubeadm_master_install.sh kubeadm_node_install.sh
   sh kubeadm_node_install.sh
```
   
Now copy the join token from the master node and execute in the worker node

Example:
```shell
   kubeadm join 172.31.43.2:6443 --token wl3td9.0ragjxhjwz1deo5t \
           --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:c9eaf691a2700c7880b33b9ca8f0b4992a4458205906993947a146f750919492
```

Now the Kubernetes cluster is ready

### What is MySQL?

MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, covering the entire range from personal projects and websites, via e-commerce and information services, all the way to high profile web properties including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Yahoo! and many more.

For more information and related downloads for MySQL Server and other MySQL products, please visit [www.mysql.com](https://www.mysql.com/)
 
**MYSQL_DATABASE** This variable is optional and allows you to specify the name of a database to be created on image startup. If a user/password was supplied then that user will be granted superuser access ([corresponding to GRANT ALL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/adding-users.html)) to this database.

**MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD** This variable is mandatory and specifies the password that will be set for the MySQL root superuser account. In the below example, it was set to rootpassword.

Now will create a mysql pod, we require some neccesary configurations for that we create configmap for database name and secret for username and passsword

```shell
   kubectl create cm db-config --from-literal=MYSQL_DATABASE=sqldb
   kubectl create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword
```

Now lets generate a yaml file to create a mysql pod

```shell
   kubectl run mysql-pod --image=mysql --dry-run=client -o yaml > mysql-pod.yml
```

Now we have to bind the configmap and secret to mysql pod

```shell
   vim mysql-pod.yml
```

```shell

```


```shell
   kubectl apply -f mysql-pod.yml
```

Now lets expose the pod using clusterIP service, so that we can connect it to phpMyAdmin

```shell
   kubectl expose pod mysql-pod --port=3306 --target-port=3306 --name=mysql-svc
```

### What is phpMyAdmin?

phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in [PHP](https://www.php.net/), intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.

**PMA_HOST** define address/host name of the MySQL server

**PMA_PORT** define port of the MySQL server

**PMA_USER and PMA_PASSWORD** define username and password to use only with the config authentication method

Now lets create a phpMyAdmin pod, so that we can manage the MySQL Database.

```shell
   kubectl get svc
   kubectl create cm phpadmin-config --from-literal=PMA_HOST=<clusterip_of_mysql> --from-literal=PMA_PORT=<mysql_port>
   kubectl create secret generic phpadmin-secret --from-literal=PMA_USER=root --from-literal=PMA_PASSWORD=rootpassword
```
Now lets generate a yaml file to create a phpMyAdmin pod

```shell
   kubectl run phpadmin-pod  --image=phpmyadmin --dry-run=client -o yaml > phpadmin-pod.yml
```

Now we have to bind the configmap and secret to phpMyAdmin pod

```shell
   vim phpadmin-pod.yml
```

```shell

```

```shell
   kubectl apply -f phpadmin-pod.yml
```

Now lets expose the pod using NodePort service, so that we can access phpMyAdmin for managing MySQL Database

```shell
   kubectl expose pod phpadmin-pod --type=NodePort --port=8099 --target-port=80 --name=phpadmin-svc
   kubectl get all
```

Access the phpMyAdmin UI using master node public ip and node port

Import the sql data

### What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but which can also be used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP can be added to straight HTML or it can be used with a variety of templating engines and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by an interpreter, which is either implemented as a native module on the web-server or as a common gateway interface (CGI). 
[wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)

In the index.html change the localhost to mysql clusterip and root user, password,mysql database name

Build the docker file

Push the image
 
```shell
   kubectl run php-app --image=iamsaikishore/phptodoapp
   kubectl expose pod php-app --type=NodePort --port=8088 --target-port=80 --name=phpapp-svc
```

To access the application public ip of master and node port
